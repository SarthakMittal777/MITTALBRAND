There\u2019s a fire in my belly. It\u2019s December 2016 at the Maverick M3 Summit in Hawaii, we\u2019re celebrating the past year together and setting intentions for 2017.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a little purple pill in my hand.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI commit to my fullest self-expression this year!\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhy?\u201d Zion asks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cBecause I want to feel free.

My greatest service will come from my greatest expression. I want to liberate my voice, and through that, give my heart\u2019s greatest gifts and my mind\u2019s highest wisdom to the people I serve, to the world I love.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I pop the pill.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That night, I freestyled. That weekend at the Maverick annual meeting, I used my voice and spoke my truth fully in a way that deeply served the Maverick EcoVerse and expanded my personal freedom. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the coming months, I stepped into my poetic gifts more than ever and really discovered what it was like to liberate my truth&#8230; including writing and performing my one man show to reveal my teenage trauma in coming of age.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A couple of months later, I finally launched Influex (the name itself is Influence + Expression), supporting other big voices with their personal expression and influence. With bringing their visionary voices to the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of those people was my friend Robbe Richman. He was there in Hawaii with us, and gave me that first little purple pill in a ceremony which inspired me to clarify my deepest intentions for the coming year.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_946\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-946\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-946\" src=\"https:\/\/www.influex.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/15626489_1364062043625131_3264944314463515311_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-946\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Robbe Richman Xplaining XPill to the Mavericks and guiding us through the ritual, including me and Zion<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, I\u2019m proud to announce that Robbe\u2019s site is the first Influex site that we\u2019re publicly launching.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it\u2019s not exactly a \u201cpersonal brand site\u201d &#8211; I felt so connected to the project through my personal story, that we wanted to include it in our first 25 Influex sites\u2026 and synchronistically, it\u2019s now the FIRST official Influex site. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discover what this little purple \u201cXpill\u201d is all about &#8211; including it\u2019s origin story at Burning Man &#8211; and how some of the biggest names in the personal development industry rave about it at the brand new <a href=\"http:\/\/xpill.com\">Xpill.com<\/a> website, artistically designed by our creative team here at Influex.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.xpill.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-947 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.influex.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Screenshot-2017-10-31-22.06.49.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1282\" height=\"980\"><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before Xpill was a thing, I actually met Robbe at a Maverick retreat in Vegas over three years ago, where he taught us a lot about culture and leadership when we were visiting Zappos. His background is in building epic company cultures. Here\u2019s more of his official accolades: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He became most well-known for being a manager and culture strategist at Zappos.com where he co-founded Zappos Insights, an innovative program educating companies on the secrets behind its game-changing employee culture. Based on his experience working with hundreds of companies on their cultures, he wrote The Culture Blueprint: a systematic guide to building the high-performance workplace. He took Zappos Insights from an idea to a multimillion dollar business line. Since then, Robbe has spoken to and consulted for Google, Toyota, Eli Lilly, Whole Foods, Intuit and many other companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Culture is our top priority at Influex and Vision Tech Team &#8211; and we eventually intend to share our own insights about company culture and more on our upcoming \u201cInfluencer Insights\u201d podcast and this blog. Robbe is an inspiration to us and we\u2019re proud to support his work with our digital artistry.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_948\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-948\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-948\" src=\"https:\/\/www.influex.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/15625910_1364061056958563_3394137856320436535_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\"><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-948\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Robbe Richman and Yanik Silver (founder of Maverick1000) at the Maverick Summit<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m staring an active volcano with my good friend and Maverick NEXT President, Zion Kim, with a burning desire for self expression.
